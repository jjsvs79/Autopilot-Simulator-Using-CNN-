# Autopilot-Simulator-Using-CNN
This is a project based on CNN, all the Credit goes to various people who have created the dataset and Nvida for publishing a paper on self driving cars.

<b>#IMPORTANT</b>

Absolutely, under NO circumstance, should one ever pilot a car using computer vision software trained with this code (or any home made software for that matter). It is extremely dangerous to use your own self-driving software in a car, even if you think you know what you're doing, not to mention it is quite illegal in most places and any accidents will land you in huge lawsuits.

This code is purely for research and statistics, absolutley NOT for application or testing of any sort.

<b>#How to Use</b>

Use python train.py to train the model

Use python run.py to run the model on a video feed

Use python run_realtime.py to run the model on live feed of webcam 

Use python run_dataset.py to run the model on the dataset

To visualize training using Tensorboard use tensorboard --logdir=./logs, then open http://0.0.0.0:6006/ into your web browser.
