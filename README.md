# Autopilot-Simulator-Using-CNN
This is a project based on CNN, all the Credit goes to various people who have created the dataset and Nvida for publishing a paper on self driving cars.
#IMPORTANT
Absolutely, under NO circumstance, should one ever pilot a car using computer vision software trained with this code (or any home made software for that matter). It is extremely dangerous to use your own self-driving software in a car, even if you think you know what you're doing, not to mention it is quite illegal in most places and any accidents will land you in huge lawsuits.

This code is purely for research and statistics, absolutley NOT for application or testing of any sort.
